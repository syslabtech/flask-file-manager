# Nginx reverse proxy config snippet to enforce 5MB upload limit
# Place this in your Nginx server block for your Flask app:

server {
    # ...existing config...
    client_max_body_size 5M;
    # ...existing config...
}

# This will block uploads larger than 5MB before they reach Flask.
# Flask itself is configured to allow up to 20MB (see app.py).
